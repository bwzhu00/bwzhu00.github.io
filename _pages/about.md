<font color="red"> I am earnestly exploring opportunities to pursue doctoral studies and would greatly value any guidance or opportunities in this regard. </font>


I am currently working as a FinTech Engineer in the Department of Technology and Product Management at <a href="https://www.abchina.com.cn/cn/default.htm" target="_blank" class="noUnderline">Agricultural Bank of China</a> (ABC) Shanghai Branch.

I obtained my Master's Degree in Computer Science at <a href="https://www.ncsu.edu" target="_blank" class="noUnderline">North Carolina State University</a> (NCSU) in May, 2024. 
Before that, I obtained my Bachelor's Degree in IoT Engineering from <a href="https://www.csu.edu.cn/" target="_blank" class="noUnderline">Central South University</a> (CSU) in June, 2022. 
During the last year of my undergraduate study, I was advised by Prof. <a href="https://faculty.csu.edu.cn/liaoshenghui/en/index/6801/list/index.htm" target="_blank" class="noUnderline">Shenghui Liao</a> for my graduation project and thesis.
I also worked as a research assistant in the lab of Prof. <a href="https://faculty.csu.edu.cn/liuxiyao/en/index/40230/list/index.htm" target="_blank" class="noUnderline">Xiyao Liu</a> for half a year since September, 2020.

<!-- While I haven't acquire substantial competitive research experience yet, -->
I'm working hard to prepare for my academic path. My personal research interest include the fields of the Internet of Things (IoT), Machine Learning, as well as their applications in healthcare, finance and other real-world scenarios.
